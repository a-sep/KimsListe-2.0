## The idea behind the example

[Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) with no build configuration.

[Material-UI](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/tree/v1-beta) is a set of React components that implement Google's Material Design specification.

[re-base](https://github.com/tylermcginnis/re-base) combines the benefits of React and Firebase by allowing each component to specify its own data dependency.
